## About Me

I am an AI-driven DevOps and automation solutions engineer specializing in **AIOps**, **agentic AI**, and **enterprise workflow automation**. I partner with internal teams and customers to design, implement, and deliver intelligent automation solutions that reduce manual work, accelerate incident response, and improve service reliability across large-scale IT operations.

At **Progressive Insurance**, I lead end-to-end delivery of AIOps solutions and AI agents that integrate telemetry, alerts, and LLM-powered capabilities into production workflows. My approach: understand the customer's pain point, find the right solution, implement it, and deliver measurable business outcomes.

I thrive at the intersection of AI/ML, DevOps, and enterprise automation—building systems that learn, adapt, and scale.
